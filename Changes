* If a header param's value somehow ended up as undef, this would produce an
  unitialized value warning. (Dave Rolsky)

0.08     2013-04-23

* Fixed a bug in the handling of defaults in content negotiation that could
  lead to errors like: Can't use string ("5") as an ARRAY ref while "strict
  refs" in use at
  /opt/perl5.16.3/lib/site_perl/5.16.3/HTTP/Headers/ActionPack/ContentNegotiation.pm
  line 160. (Dave Rolsky)

* The PriorityList class treated "q=0" as if it was "q=1". RFC 2616 makes it
  clear that "0" is fine. (Dave Rolsky)

* Language and character set negotiation now canonicalizes all values. This
  means that if you say you provide "UTF-8" and a client requests "utf8" it
  will just work. (Dave Rolsky)
* There are two new classes, HTTP::Headers::ActionPackage::AcceptCharset and
  AcceptLanguage. (Dave Rolsky)
* If an Accept-Charset header does not contain "*" or "ISO-8859-1", then
  "ISO-8859-1" is given a priority of 1.0, per RFC-2616. (Dave Rolsky)
* Content negotiation will never return any item explicitly forbidden
  ("q=0.0") in the headers, even if the header says it accepts "*" or that
  item is specified as a default in your code. (Dave Rolsky)
* The HTTP::Headers::ActionPack->inflate method now works with Web::Request
  object. (Jesse Luehrs)
* Fix tests that were broken in the absence of HTTP::Message::PSGI. (Florian
  Ragwitz)

* Fix the HTTP::Message::PSGI errors
* When you inflate a header object that has already been inflated, ignore that
  header and keep looping. (Florian Ragwitz)
