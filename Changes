Revision history for Perl extension HTTP::Headers::ActionPack

    - Language and character set negotiation now canonicalize all values. This
      means that if you say you provide "UTF-8" and a client requests "utf8"
      it will just work. (Dave Rolsky)
    - There are two new classes, HTTP::Headers::ActionPackage::AcceptCharset
      and AcceptLanguage. (Dave Rolsky)
    - If an Accept-Charset header does not contain "*" or "ISO-8859-1", then
      "ISO-8859-1" is given a priority of 1.0, per RFC-2616. (Dave Rolsky)
    - Fix tests that were broken in the absence of HTTP::Message::PSGI

0.05 Mon. Nov. 26th, 2012

      been inflated, ignore that header and keep looping
        - thanks to Florian Ragwitz for spoting this
